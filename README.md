# Samaveda

Samaveda is a social web app that allows users to annotate and comment on songs and music. It uses [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [Spotify Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/). 

On the front end, Samaveda uses React to control playback. To run it in the development server, enter the React directory and run:

### npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

(Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).)
